-- migrate:up
-- Rent first (the founder, 2026-10-18; docs/law.md): a tenant's payment, a credit and a deposit
-- kept at move-out pay a lease's rent before its other charges. Washington requires it of every
-- payment (RCW 59.18.283), the strictest state found, and it is the tenant's due everywhere.
-- Before this, charges were paid oldest first and two due the same day in the order of their
-- random ids, so the same lease could be charged a different late fee by chance.
--
--   trust_pay_rank        a charge's place: 0 rent, 1 a monthly charge (its recurring fees, and
--                         a lease end's fee for days back of either), 2 anything else.
--   trust_open_charges    credits come off the rent (oldest first) before the other charges
--                         (oldest first); a late fee is worked out from it, so it no longer
--                         depends on chance.
--   trust_report_delinquency   counts them the same way.
--   trust_return_deposit  keeps the rent of every lease the tenants moved through first, lease
--                         by lease, then their other charges, each matched to what is open of it.
--
-- The app pays a payment and prepaid rent in the same order (src/pms/api/rent.py). Matches
-- already made stand: nothing here moves money.

-- On a live database, give up rather than queue behind a long transaction while holding locks.
