-- migrate:up
-- Interest added to a security deposit gets a part of its own in the owner's year-end package (the
-- founder, 2026-10-22, q041). Added to a deposit (migration 0122), interest leaves the owner's
-- property account with its cash; the income statements list it since migration 0125, but the
-- year-end package still counted it with "other". Now it is "security deposit interest", before
-- "other", on every property, as each of the package's parts is, and the parts still come to the
-- closing balance. Interest paid as a rent credit moves no money: it stays rent not collected.

-- On a live database, give up rather than queue behind a long transaction while holding locks.
