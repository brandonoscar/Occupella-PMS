-- The late fee run reads only the rents that can still owe a late fee (the enterprise test,
-- 2026-10-30).
--
-- trust_assess_late_fees reached every rent past its grace without a late fee: every rent ever
-- paid on time among them. It locked each one and worked out what was open of it at the end of
-- its grace through trust_open_charges, so each run took longer with every month of rent. On a
-- company of 20,000 units a year after it switched, the nightly run took 321 s on GitHub's
-- runner (5.1 s on the day it switched, on a 4-core machine); on 1,000 units a year on, the late
-- fees took 16.2 s of it to charge nothing, reaching 10,791 rents none of which could owe one.
--
-- A rent whose own payments by the end of its grace, less what of them bounced by then, covered
-- it is not open then: credits and waivers only take more off. Those are now passed over before
-- the lock, with what their payments and bounces say. Which rents are charged a late fee, of
-- what, and in what order, are unchanged.
